# FIRELab - Wildfire Imagery Analysis and Processing
### From vegetation characterization to fire segmentation and progression, and much more, FIRELab helps environmental researchers, data scientists and engineers streamline their work. <br> All this aligned with a responsive, easy-to-use, all-in-one platform.

<hr>

This project was developed in the context of [Project in Informatics](https://www.ua.pt/en/uc/12276) curricular unit, part of the Informatics Engineering Degree of [University of Aveiro](https://www.ua.pt/).

It fits in the MoST Project, financed by the [Foundation of Science and Technology](https://www.fct.pt/), in which DETI (Department of Electronics, Telecomunications and Informatics) and DAO (Department of Environment and Planning), of UA, and INESC-TEC, of Porto, participate in. 



## About the project

The goal of the project was to develop a set of tools as well as implement and adapt already developed tools and aggregate them in a ready to use web application of processing support, analysis and visualization of data on the forest fire propagation and gas emission to the atmosphere.


## Deploy

The Project was deployed on a [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/) VM, utilizing the platform's credit for students. 

It can be accessed on: http://20.199.124.98/ (in order to test it, create a free account first and then log in). 

If you'd like to install and use the system locally, please consult the [FIRELab Wiki](https://github.com/itskikat/firelab/wiki)
